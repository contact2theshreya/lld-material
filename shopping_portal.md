## Functionalities of Online Shopping System:
I have added a few functions here to help understand the basic concepts of OOPs in Java. You can add more such functionalities as per your requirements:

To browse and search for products.
To add items to a shopping cart.
To add new products.
To have the ability to place an order.
To view order history.
To track the shipping method of an order.
