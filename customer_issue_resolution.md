Designing a **Customer Issue Resolution System** (CIRS) in Java involves creating an architecture that handles customer issues, assigns them to support agents, tracks the status, and manages workflows for resolution. Here's how we can structure this system using classes, methods, and interaction patterns to address customer complaints efficiently.

---

### Key Components:
1. **Customer**: Represents a customer who raises an issue.
2. **Issue**: Represents the issue raised by the customer.
3. **SupportAgent**: Represents a support agent who works on issues.
4. **IssueQueue**: Manages the queue of unresolved issues.
5. **IssueResolutionSystem**: Coordinates the overall resolution process.
6. **IssueStatus**: Represents different stages of issue resolution (e.g., `New`, `Assigned`, `InProgress`, `Resolved`).

### Low-Level Design (LLD) in Java

---

### 1. **Customer Class**
Represents the customer who raises an issue.

```java
public class Customer {
    private int customerId;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public Customer(int customerId, String name, String email) {
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public int getCustomerId() {
        return customerId;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

---

### 2. **Issue Class**
Represents the issue raised by a customer.

```java
public class Issue {
    private int issueId;
    private Customer customer;
    private String description;
    private String priority; // "Low", "Medium", "High"
    private String status; // "New", "Assigned", "InProgress", "Resolved"
    private SupportAgent assignedAgent;
    private String resolutionComments;

    public Issue(int issueId, Customer customer, String description, String priority) {
        this.issueId = issueId;
        this.customer = customer;
        this.description = description;
        this.priority = priority;
        this.status = "New";
    }

    public int getIssueId() {
        return issueId;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public String getStatus() {
        return status;
    }

    public void assignAgent(SupportAgent agent) {
        this.assignedAgent = agent;
        this.status = "Assigned";
    }

    public void startResolution(String comments) {
        this.status = "InProgress";
        this.resolutionComments = comments;
    }

    public void resolveIssue(String resolution) {
        this.status = "Resolved";
        this.resolutionComments = resolution;
    }

    public SupportAgent getAssignedAgent() {
        return assignedAgent;
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **SupportAgent Class**
Represents a support agent who works on resolving issues.

```java
public class SupportAgent {
    private int agentId;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public SupportAgent(int agentId, String name, String email) {
        this.agentId = agentId;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public int getAgentId() {
        return agentId;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void resolveIssue(Issue issue, String resolution) {
        issue.resolveIssue(resolution);
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **IssueQueue Class**
Manages the queue of unresolved issues and assigns issues to available agents.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IssueQueue {
    private Queue<Issue> issueQueue;

    public IssueQueue() {
        this.issueQueue = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public void addIssue(Issue issue) {
        issueQueue.offer(issue);
    }

    public Issue getNextIssue() {
        return issueQueue.poll();
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return issueQueue.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

---

### 5. **IssueResolutionSystem Class**
Coordinates the overall process, from receiving a customer issue to assigning agents and resolving issues.

```java
public class IssueResolutionSystem {
    private List<SupportAgent> supportAgents;
    private IssueQueue issueQueue;

    public IssueResolutionSystem() {
        this.supportAgents = new ArrayList<>();
        this.issueQueue = new IssueQueue();
    }

    public void addSupportAgent(SupportAgent agent) {
        supportAgents.add(agent);
    }

    public void receiveIssue(Issue issue) {
        issueQueue.addIssue(issue);
        System.out.println("New issue received: " + issue.getDescription());
    }

    public void assignNextIssue() {
        if (!issueQueue.isEmpty()) {
            Issue issue = issueQueue.getNextIssue();
            if (issue != null) {
                SupportAgent agent = findAvailableAgent();
                if (agent != null) {
                    issue.assignAgent(agent);
                    System.out.println("Assigned issue " + issue.getIssueId() + " to agent " + agent.getName());
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void startResolution(Issue issue, String comments) {
        if (issue != null) {
            issue.startResolution(comments);
            System.out.println("Issue " + issue.getIssueId() + " is now in progress.");
        }
    }

    public void resolveIssue(Issue issue, String resolution) {
        if (issue != null) {
            SupportAgent agent = issue.getAssignedAgent();
            if (agent != null) {
                agent.resolveIssue(issue, resolution);
                System.out.println("Issue " + issue.getIssueId() + " has been resolved.");
            }
        }
    }

    private SupportAgent findAvailableAgent() {
        for (SupportAgent agent : supportAgents) {
            // Here, we can implement logic to find an available agent (e.g., check their current workload)
            return agent; // For simplicity, we are returning the first available agent
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

---

### 6. **Main Class to Run the System**
The main class simulates receiving customer issues, assigning them to agents, and resolving them.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create customers
        Customer customer1 = new Customer(1, "John Doe", "johndoe@example.com");
        Customer customer2 = new Customer(2, "Jane Smith", "janesmith@example.com");

        // Create support agents
        SupportAgent agent1 = new SupportAgent(1, "Agent A", "agentA@example.com");
        SupportAgent agent2 = new SupportAgent(2, "Agent B", "agentB@example.com");

        // Create IssueResolutionSystem
        IssueResolutionSystem issueSystem = new IssueResolutionSystem();
        issueSystem.addSupportAgent(agent1);
        issueSystem.addSupportAgent(agent2);

        // Customer raises issues
        Issue issue1 = new Issue(101, customer1, "Unable to log in to the system", "High");
        Issue issue2 = new Issue(102, customer2, "Error while processing payment", "Medium");

        issueSystem.receiveIssue(issue1);
        issueSystem.receiveIssue(issue2);

        // Assign issues to support agents
        issueSystem.assignNextIssue();
        issueSystem.assignNextIssue();

        // Start resolving an issue
        issueSystem.startResolution(issue1, "Investigating login credentials issue");

        // Resolve the issue
        issueSystem.resolveIssue(issue1, "Login issue resolved, credentials updated.");

        // Issue 2 resolution
        issueSystem.startResolution(issue2, "Investigating payment gateway issue");
        issueSystem.resolveIssue(issue2, "Payment issue resolved, gateway fixed.");
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Classes:**

1. **Customer**: Stores information about the customer who raised the issue (e.g., `name`, `email`).
2. **Issue**: Stores information about an issue raised by a customer, such as the `description`, `priority`, and `status`. It can be assigned to an agent and tracked as it's worked on.
3. **SupportAgent**: Represents a support agent who works on issues. The agent can resolve issues.
4. **IssueQueue**: Stores a queue of unresolved issues. The system processes issues from this queue and assigns them to agents.
5. **IssueResolutionSystem**: This class coordinates the entire issue resolution process, such as receiving new issues, assigning them to support agents, starting and completing the resolution process.
6. **Main**: This class simulates real-world usage by creating customers, issues, agents, and using the system to resolve issues.

---

### **Execution Flow:**

1. A **Customer** raises an issue by submitting a description and priority level.
2. The issue is received and added to the **IssueQueue**.
3. The system assigns the issue to an available **SupportAgent**.
4. The issue is marked as **InProgress** once the agent starts working on it.
5. Once resolved, the issue status is marked as **Resolved**, and the resolution is recorded.

This **LLD** focuses on the creation of core components and interaction between them to handle customer issue resolution. You can extend it with more advanced features like priority handling, SLA (Service Level Agreement) tracking, or more detailed reporting.
